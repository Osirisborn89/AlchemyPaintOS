## Notes
- Compass: Harlequins = high-contrast patterns (diamonds/checkers) + bright accent colours + glossy gems.
- Truth Pass v2: keep patterns achievable; diamonds live primarily on **Bodysuit Patterns**. Armour can stay solid.
- Inventory-only paints; Generic only for materials like texture paste.
