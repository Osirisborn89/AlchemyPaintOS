Repo hygiene milestone (gold-standard readiness)



Nested duplicate folders removed via quarantine:



data\\data



docs\\docs



references\\references



Canonical paths verified present afterward, with snapshot created for rollback safety.



Remaining work



✅ None for Truth Pass placeholder cleanup.

Next phase is frontend/dashboard build + later Phase B scheme accuracy review (still research-anchored, but not about placeholders).
