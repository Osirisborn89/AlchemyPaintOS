# PROJECT OVERVIEW

## Purpose
A data-driven paint recipe system for Warhammer factions and surfaces, using:
- recipes.csv for recipe metadata
- recipe_steps.csv for step-by-step paint instructions
- inventory_export.csv to ensure every non-Generic paint step uses an owned paint
- targets.md per surface as the research anchor trail

## Current status
- AUDIT PASS (Core + Truth Pass gates)
- Recipes: 401, Steps: 1741, Factions: 39

## Operating rules
- Snapshot before edits
- Micro-batches
- Run audit after edits
- Keep guardrails green
