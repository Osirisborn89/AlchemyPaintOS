# ROADMAP

## Now
- Stable baseline achieved: all audits green; no placeholders; inventory enforcement clean.

## Next (Phase B)
- Research-first refinement per faction/surface:
  - Use targets.md as the compass
  - Map the official/studio look to closest owned paints
  - Keep step counts consistent and guardrails green

## Later
- Variant expansions (optional surfaces, alternate schemes) once Phase B is complete.
