# MILESTONES

## Completed
- Truth Pass v2: placeholder elimination across all factions (placeholder recipes and steps now at 0).
- Repo structure normalization: nested dupes removed; canonical paths confirmed.

## Next
- Phase B Truth Pass: improve accuracy per faction vs targets.md references (box art / official scheme alignment).
- Optional: expand targets.md anchors per surface (more official sources, product pages, WarCom articles).
