Unreleased

Truth Pass v2 — Completed (2026-01-07)



Truth Pass v2 brought all placeholder recipes/steps to 0.



All factions/surfaces remain inventory-enforced: every non-Generic step must map to data/inventory/inventory\_export.csv (Brand + Paint Name).



Research anchoring enforced via references/\*\*/TARGETS/targets.md (at least one link per used reference folder).



Repo hygiene: removed accidental nested dup folders (data\\data, docs\\docs, references\\references) via quarantine + rollback snapshot.
