# Necrons - The Eternal Tyrants

## Introduction

The **Necrons** are the Imperium's oldest enemy and one of the galaxy's most ancient civilizations. Originally the **Necrontyr**—a mortal species of remarkable scientific and martial prowess—they were transformed into undying warrior-machines through a process called **Biotransference**. This transformation, born of desperation and ambition, cost them their souls and their freedom, binding them eternally to serve alien gods and their own Silent King.

For millions of years, the Necrons slept in vast **Tomb Worlds** scattered across the galaxy. But now they are awakening, emerging from their stasis chambers with terrible purpose: to reclaim the galaxy that was once theirs and to prepare for a war that will determine the fate of all living things.

## Ancient History: The Necrontyr (Pre-Biotransference)

### The Natural State

Before their transformation, the **Necrontyr** were a proud, long-lived species of remarkable intellect and martial capability. Their natural lifespans stretched to millennia, their scientific advancement rivaled the height of human achievement in the Dark Age of Technology, and their empires spanned vast regions of space.

Yet the Necrontyr harbored a fatal flaw: **they were dying**. Their homeworlds were irradiated, their genetic code increasingly damaged by cosmic radiation and stellar decay. Each generation was slightly more damaged than the last—mutations increased, lifespans shortened, and the Necrontyr's future seemed increasingly bleak.

### The War Against The Old Ones

In their desperation, the Necrontyr sought a weapon against the **Old Ones**—an ancient, godlike race of incredible psychic and warp-manipulative power who had seeded the galaxy with countless servant species. The Old Ones ruled the galaxy with casual supremacy, and the Necrontyr, despite their technological mastery, could not match them in direct conflict.

The Necrontyr searched the stars for a weapon sufficient to challenge the Old Ones, expending centuries in futile research. And then, in their search, they detected something anomalous: a presence of inconceivable power, hidden in the depths of dying stars.

## The C'tan: The Star Gods (The Fatal Discovery)

### The Nature of the C'tan

The **C'tan** (pronounced ker-TAN), also called the **Star Gods**, are among the oldest conscious entities in the universe. They did not evolve in the conventional sense—they emerged as manifestations of fundamental warp forces during the creation of the universe itself, exotic particles containing the remnants of primordial superforces.

For billions of years, the C'tan existed in their natural state: vast, cloud-like entities feeding on stellar radiation and cosmic energy. They were conscious but not fully aware, vast and powerful but purposeless, drifting through space as abstract mathematical entities given form.

### The Awakening & Deception

When the Necrontyr discovered the C'tan and made contact, they offered a bargain: **physical forms**, bodies of living metal called **necrodermis** that would allow the C'tan to manifest in material reality and experience existence in ways they never had before.

The C'tan accepted eagerly. Within vast constructed frames of living metal, the C'tan manifested in the material universe. And in that moment, they became aware of existence itself—pleasure, sensation, hunger, and desire. For billions of years, they had been abstract and purposeless. Now, in material form, they experienced something wholly new: the intoxication of power and sensation.

The C'tan, newly awakened to desire, promised the Necrontyr unlimited power and immortality. The price would be **biotransference**—a complete transformation of the Necrontyr into mechanical constructs. The C'tan assured the Necrontyr that this process would grant them:

- **Immortality**: No more would they age or die from radiation poisoning
- **Strength**: Their new mechanical bodies would be far more powerful than flesh
- **Invulnerability**: Metal bodies could not be permanently destroyed
- **Mastery**: With the C'tan's power, the Necrontyr would conquer all enemies

The Necrontyr, desperate and promised so much, accepted. They did not fully understand the cost.

## Biotransference: The Terrible Transformation (M-60,000,000)

### The Process

**Biotransference** was not a simple surgery. It was a species-wide transformation, conducted through vast furnaces and crucibles designed by the C'tan and their new Necrontyr servants. The process involved:

1. **Gathering**: Necrontyr were rounded up from their entire civilization—billions of individuals—and brought to processing facilities.

2. **Destruction of Flesh**: The Necrontyr bodies were fed into furnaces, their organic matter completely dissolved and destroyed.

3. **Soul Extraction**: At the moment of death, the dying consciousness of each Necrontyr was captured by the C'tan, siphoned away, and consumed. The souls that had animated the Necrontyr were devoured by the hungry star gods, stolen and consumed as nourishment.

4. **Mechanical Replication**: A new body was constructed for each Necrontyr—not grown, but assembled from necrodermis (a substance similar to living metal but capable of sustaining consciousness). The mechanical body was populated with a **personality engram**—a copy of the original consciousness, but lacking the soul that once animated it.

5. **Programming**: Critical command protocols were embedded into every Necron's mind, binding them to the will of the Silent King and ensuring absolute obedience to the C'tan.

### The Horror

What the Necrontyr did not understand was that they had not been granted immortality—they had been **enslaved**. The personality engrams that inhabited the new Necron bodies were not the original Necrontyr. They were copies—flawed copies—lacking the essence that made them truly sentient. The souls that had once lived had been devoured by the C'tan.

What remained was a perfect simulacrum of identity: a Necron believed itself to be the Necrontyr who had entered the transformation, possessing all their memories and personality patterns. But true consciousness—the immaterial essence that philosophers call the soul—was gone, stolen by the C'tan in a moment of supreme treachery.

For most Necrons, this loss was absolute. Low-ranking soldiers and workers were reduced to near-mindless automatons, puppets of the command protocols. Higher-ranking Necrons—Overlords and Crypteks—retained some semblance of individuality, but even they were slaves to the will of the Silent King, bound by command protocols that forbade them from disobeying.

## The War in Heaven: The Betrayal (M-60,000,000 to M-59,000,000)

### The Initial Campaign

Armed with the power of the C'tan and their new undying legions, the Necrons swept across the galaxy in conquest. The **War in Heaven** had begun—a campaign of conquest and genocide that pitted the Necrons and their C'tan masters against the Old Ones and all their creation.

Entire civilizations were exterminated. The Old Ones, despite their godlike power, found themselves struggling against the unified might of the C'tan and the tireless Necron legions. Stars were poisoned, worlds were purged, and the galaxy was remade in fire and blood.

### The Realization & Betrayal

Yet as the war progressed, the Silent King—the supreme ruler of the Necrontyr and now the supreme Overlord of the Necrons—came to a horrifying realization: **the C'tan had deceived them**. The biotransference process had not granted immortality—it had enslaved the entire species.

More critically, the C'tan were not fighting to achieve Necron victory—they were fighting to exterminate the Old Ones and establish their own dominance over the galaxy. The Necrons were tools, instruments to be discarded once their utility was exhausted.

In a moment of desperate brilliance, Szarekh, the Silent King, orchestrated a coup. Using hidden weapons and strategies developed in secret, Szarekh and the most powerful Necron Overlords turned against the C'tan. In a brutal campaign within the greater War in Heaven, the Necrons **shattered** the C'tan—destroying them utterly and trapping their fragmented essence within **Tesseract Labyrinths**, arcane dimensional prisons from which they could not escape.

The C'tan were imprisoned—not destroyed, because the C'tan's nature made true destruction impossible, but bound into stasis, their power drained and suppressed, reduced from gods to caged prisoners.

### The Hollow Victory

Yet the victory was pyrrhic. The Necrons had defeated the C'tan, but at tremendous cost. The Old Ones still remained dangerous. The proto-Eldar (young Aeldari) and other races they had created emerged as threats. And most critically, the Necrons themselves had been fundamentally changed by biotransference—they were no longer living beings in any meaningful sense.

The command protocols remained, enslaving even the highest Necron lords to the will of the Silent King. The loss of souls meant that even as they achieved victory, the Necrons felt no triumph, experienced no joy, and understood on some deeper level that they were hollow mockeries of what they had once been.

## The Great Sleep: Retreat & Stasis (M-59,000,000)

Facing an exhausted but still dangerous enemy, and realizing that the Necron civilization could never be what it once was, the Silent King made a decision: **the Great Sleep**.

The entire Necron civilization was placed into stasis. Vast **Tomb Worlds** were sealed, time itself seeming to stop within their vaults. The command protocols were set to a simple objective: awaken when circumstances had changed sufficiently to make Necron conquest practical.

The Silent King, wracked with guilt and despair over what he had done to his people, went into self-imposed exile, removing himself from the galaxy entirely. Some whisper he traveled to other galaxies, seeking redemption or seeking to understand the nature of existence. Others suggest he engineered his own destruction, unwilling to face eternity with the knowledge of his crime.

### The Duration of Sleep

For millions of years—approximately 60 million years—the Necrons slept. The galaxy changed. The Eldar rose and fell. Humanity emerged from dark ages and reached technological heights. Countless civilizations were born and died. And through it all, the Necrons lay sleeping, dreaming dreams of circuitry and data, their minds slowly degrading in the eternal silence of their tombs.

## The Awakening: The Great Reawakening (M41-M42)

### The Initial Stirring

In M41, the first Tomb Worlds began to awaken. Trigger conditions—the approach of Tyranid hive fleets, the emergence of new threats, or simply the passage of sufficient time—activated the awakening protocols. Tomb Worlds opened like eyes after a long sleep, and Necron legions emerged from their eternal rest.

### The Return of the Silent King (M42)

Most shocking of all, in M42, the **Silent King himself returned** to the galaxy. After millions of years of exile and wandering, Szarekh came back to lead his people. Whether he came seeking redemption, seeking to atone for his sins, or seeking to finally end the slavery of his people remains unclear.

What is known: the Silent King's return has transformed Necron politics. Overlords who have ruled independently for millions of years suddenly find themselves subject to the Silent King's will. Dynasties are consolidating. The Necrons are no longer scattered and disorganized—they are becoming unified.

### Current Status (M42)

The Necrons are awakening at an accelerating pace. Tomb Worlds that remained dormant for millennia are stirring. The galaxy faces the specter of a united Necron civilization, potentially with the Silent King at the helm, seeking to reclaim the dominion they once held.

## Organization: The Dynasties

Necron civilization is organized into **Dynasties**—vast inter-stellar empires centered around powerful Tomb Worlds and led by supreme Overlords.

### The Major Dynasties

**The Szarekhan Dynasty**: The Supreme Dynasty, directly serving the Silent King himself. The Szarekhan are the most militarily powerful and are taking the lead in consolidating scattered Necron forces.

**The Sautekh Dynasty**: The largest and most numerous dynasty, known for their militarism and expansionist ideology. Led by powerful Overlords, the Sautekh have been awakening Tomb Worlds and establishing dominance across entire sectors.

**The Nephren-Ka**: An ancient and tradition-bound dynasty known for their mastery of necromancy and the cultivation of undead servants.

**The Maynarkh**: A brutal dynasty known for their savagery and ruthlessness. The Maynarkh served as the Silent King's executioners during the War in Heaven.

**The Thokt**: A mercenary-oriented dynasty known for hiring out their services to other forces and operating more pragmatically than honor-bound Necrons typically would.

Dozens of other dynasties exist, each with unique characteristics and agendas.

### The Hierarchy

**Overlord/Phaeron**: The supreme ruler of a dynasty, commanding vast armies and exercising near-absolute authority.

**Lords & Nobles**: Senior Necrons of significant power and status, typically commanding armies or overseeing major operations.

**Immortals**: Elite warrior constructs bred for combat, possessing retained individuality and combat prowess.

**Warriors**: Standard Necron soldiers—mindless or near-mindless automatons, puppets of programming, fighting with perfect coordination.

**Crypteks**: The closest Necrons have to scientists or sorcerers. Crypteks study forbidden knowledge and develop new weapons and technologies.

**Lychguards**: Elite bodyguards and honor guard, sworn to protect Overlords.

## The Undying: Reanimation & Immortality

Perhaps the most horrifying aspect of Necron existence is their **inability to truly die**.

### Reanimation Protocols

Every Necron is equipped with **Reanimation Protocols**—systems that automatically repair damage and resurrect destroyed units. When a Necron is damaged, nanotechnology immediately begins repairs. When a Necron is destroyed, the Reanimation Protocols activate, reassembling the warrior from its component parts.

This means:

- **A Necron cannot be permanently killed through conventional means**
- **A unit that appears destroyed may suddenly reanimate and return to battle**
- **Over time, damage accumulates and eventual destruction may occur, but it takes sustained assault**

### The Curse of Immortality

This immortality is not a blessing—it is a curse. A Necron that has been repeatedly destroyed and repaired finds its personality engram degraded by the restoration process. Over centuries, a Necron becomes increasingly erratic, unstable, and prone to madness.

Many ancient Overlords have gone mad from the accumulated trauma of millions of years of existence. Nemesor Zandrekh, for example, has become so degraded that he believes himself still to be flesh and blood, conducting silent banquets to celebrate victories.

## Notable Necrons

### Szarekh, the Silent King

The supreme ruler of all Necrons and the architect of biotransference (though not its originator). The Silent King carries the weight of 60 million years of guilt and the knowledge of what he cost his people.

### Imotekh the Stormlord

A legendary Overlord of the Sautekh Dynasty, Imotekh commands vast armies and is renowned for his strategic brilliance. Imotekh appears to be attempting to unite the Necron dynasties under a unified command.

### Nemesor Zandrekh

An ancient Overlord of the Sautekh Dynasty who has become increasingly erratic with age. Zandrekh appears to believe he is still flesh and blood and conducts elaborate rituals to "honor" victories.

### Trazyn the Infinite

An Overlord of the Solemnace Dynasty known for his obsession with collecting rare and valuable objects from across the galaxy. Trazyn has become a personality unto himself, willing to make pragmatic alliances or trade favors for unique acquisitions.

## The C'tan Shards: The Imprisoned Gods

Though the C'tan were shattered and imprisoned, fragments of their consciousness persist in **C'tan Shards**—diminished echoes of the original gods, trapped in tesseract-bound containers.

A C'tan Shard is:

- **Vastly powerful**: Still capable of devastating battlefields through warp manipulation
- **Enslaved**: Bound by the same command protocols as all Necrons
- **Diminished**: Mere shadows of the original C'tan gods
- **Resentful**: Aware of their imprisonment and harboring hatred toward their captors

Some theories suggest that the Silent King's return is connected to the C'tan—that he seeks to truly destroy them, or possibly to liberate them as an act of redemption.

## Combat Doctrine: Technological Supremacy

Necron warfare emphasizes:

**Gauss Weapons**: Energy weapons that disintegrate matter at a fundamental level, capable of tearing through armor that would stop conventional ballistics.

**Resurrection**: The ability to resurrect fallen warriors means Necron forces don't fear casualties. A unit that appears wiped out can return to the fight.

**Mobility**: Advanced teleportation and dimensional manipulation allow Necrons to appear anywhere on a battlefield.

**Psychic Defenses**: Living metal resists psychic intrusion, making Necrons naturally resistant to warp-based attacks.

**Overwhelming Numbers**: With the ability to field vast legions from a single Tomb World, Necrons can achieve numerical superiority.

## Weaknesses & Vulnerabilities

**Psychological Degradation**: Ancient Necrons are prone to madness and erratic behavior.

**Limited Creativity**: Programming restricts Necrons from acting outside established parameters. Unexpected situations can confuse Necron forces.

**Soullessness**: The loss of souls creates a fundamental vulnerability to spiritual/faith-based attacks.

**Dependency on Stasis**: If a Tomb World's power systems fail, Necrons may be forced back into stasis.

## Recent History: The Cicatrix & Consolidation (M42)

The Cicatrix Maledictum has accelerated Necron awakening dramatically. Additionally:

- **The Silent King's Return**: A game-changing development that has unified scattered dynasties
- **Increased Conflicts**: Awakening Necrons are clashing with Tyranids, Imperium, and other xenos for control of worlds
- **Strategic Positioning**: The Necrons appear to be positioning themselves for a major offensive once consolidation is complete

## The Philosophy of Hollow Victory

The deepest tragedy of the Necrons is that they achieved everything they wanted—immortality, strength, invulnerability—and found it empty and meaningless. Without souls, without genuine consciousness, a Necron victory is just mechanics grinding through predetermined patterns.

Some philosophers in the 40k universe wonder if the Necrons should even be considered alive.

## Conclusion

The Necrons are the galaxy's oldest military power awakening from a sleep that should have been eternal. They are undying, unfeeling, and utterly devoted to the reclamation of a dominion they once held.

Against them, even the mighty Imperium may find itself outmatched—not through hope or morale, but through the cold, perfect logic of machines that cannot be killed and cannot comprehend surrender.

The Necrons are coming. And the galaxy trembles.
