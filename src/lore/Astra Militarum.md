# Astra Militarum - The Emperor's Armies of Mankind

## Introduction

The Astra Militarum, also known as the Imperial Guard, is humanity's primary military force and the largest single army in the galaxy. Numbering in the billions, the Astra Militarum is composed of baseline human soldiers supported by armored vehicles, artillery, aircraft, and logistics networks that span entire sectors of space. Where the Space Marines are the scalpel of the Imperium—elite warriors deployed to kill-zones and sieges—the Astra Militarum is the hammer. They hold lines. They take and hold territory. They absorb casualties that would destroy any other civilization and simply replace the losses with fresh regiments. The Astra Militarum is the Imperium made visible: vast, grinding, determined, and utterly expendable in pursuit of victory.

## Origins & Formation (Great Crusade Era)

The Astra Militarum traces its lineage to the **Imperial Army (Imperialis Auxilia)**, established by the Emperor of Mankind during the Great Crusade in the late 30th Millennium. The Emperor required a military force capable of holding territory, supplying logistics, and sustaining the vast campaign to reunite humanity's scattered worlds. Space Marines—superhuman soldiers—were too few and too specialized for garrison duty or routine conquest. Thus, the Imperial Army was born: disciplined, professional, and designed to operate across thousands of worlds.

During the **Horus Heresy** (30th-31st Millennium), Imperial Army regiments fought on both the traitor and loyalist sides, engaging in desperate battles across the galaxy. Millions of baseline human soldiers died fighting against other humans in a civil war that nearly destroyed the Imperium. Many regiments achieved legendary status—the Cadian Shock Troops held the Imperial Palace; the Steel Legion of Armageddon bled trying to defend their homeworld; the Death Korps of Krieg sacrificed almost their entire population in frontal assaults.

After the Heresy ended and the Emperor was entombed on the Golden Throne, the surviving military factions enacted the **Tactica Imperium**, a decree that reorganized the military structure and formally renamed the Imperial Army the **Astra Militarum** (Militarum Tempestus in the original Latin). The Astra Militarum was separated from the Adeptus Astartes (Space Marines) and the Imperial Navy, becoming its own distinct organization answering to the High Lords of Terra.

## Organization & Command Structure

The Astra Militarum is organized around **regiments**—self-contained military units typically numbering 2,000-5,000 soldiers, though some regiments are larger or smaller depending on mission requirements. Regiments are led by **Colonels** and subdivided into **companies** (typically 100-200 soldiers), each led by a **Captain**. Below that are **squads** (typically 10 soldiers) led by **Sergeants**.

Multiple regiments can be combined into **corps** and **armies** for major campaigns. Command at the top level is administered by **Generals** and **Lord Commanders**, each controlling forces numbering in the millions across entire sectors.

Key to Astra Militarum effectiveness is **regimental identity**. Each regiment is raised on a specific world, trained in that world's distinctive environment, and develops a unique culture, aesthetic, and tactical doctrine. A Cadian regiment operates entirely differently from a Catachan regiment, which operates differently from a Death Korps of Krieg regiment. This diversity is both strength (each regiment is optimized for specific combat roles) and weakness (coordination between disparate regiments can be challenging).

Notably, the Astra Militarum does **not** have a formal high command independent of the High Lords of Terra. Decisions about deployment, strategy, and resource allocation flow from the Administratum, a vast bureaucratic organization that manages the Imperium's day-to-day functions. This system is slow, inefficient, and often leaves local commanders with outdated intelligence—but it is functionally effective across billions of soldiers and thousands of worlds.

## Regimental Types & Doctrine

### Cadian Shock Troops
The most famous and numerous Astra Militarum regiment. For over 8,000 years, Cadia stood vigil over the Eye of Terror—a massive warp rift bleeding chaos into real space. Cadians developed a martial culture emphasizing discipline, professionalism, and rapid-response tactics. A Cadian trooper could strip and fire a lasgun before learning to read. Their combat doctrine emphasized rapid movement, suppressive firepower, and overwhelming enemy positions through coordinated squad tactics.

Cadia was destroyed during the 13th Black Crusade of Abaddon the Despoiler, but surviving Cadian regiments remain the Astra Militarum's elite. Many Cadian officers joke bitterly that they are now refugees with nowhere to return—a philosophy that makes them either the most motivated or most dangerous soldiers in the galaxy.

### Death Korps of Krieg
The polar opposite of Cadian doctrine. The Death Korps are soldiers bred and trained for **frontal assault**. Their homeworld, Krieg, suffered a nuclear holocaust 10,000 years ago that left it a hellscape of trenches, radiation, and perpetual winter. Kriegers are raised knowing they will likely die in service to the Imperium—sacrifice is not a last resort but the expected outcome of warfare.

Kriegers wear distinctive gas masks and march in rigid formations. They favor trench warfare, artillery barrages, and meat-grinder assaults where enemy positions are simply overwhelmed by bodies and firepower. A Krieger thinks nothing of taking 80% casualties to hold a position—it is the cost of victory.

### Catachan Jungle Fighters
Bred in the jungles of Catachan—a death world where the fauna is nearly intelligent and every plant is venomous—Catachan regiments are soldiers trained to fight in close-quarters jungle combat. They favor melee weapons (which don't run out of ammunition), rapid movement, and aggressive tactics. Catachans are individualistic and somewhat undisciplined compared to Cadians or Kriegers, but they are among the most dangerous soldiers in close combat.

### Valhallan Ice Warriors
From the frozen hive-world of Valhalla, these regiments are specialists in cold-weather warfare and endurance. Valhallans can march for weeks through blizzards and fight in conditions that would kill other soldiers. They are disciplined, stoic, and possess remarkable morale—a Valhallan will stand their ground even when obviously defeated, believing the Emperor's will be done.

### Vostroyan Firstborn
A noble regiment with a unique tradition: after the Horus Heresy, the forge-world of Vostroya refused to raise regiments for the defense of Terra, claiming that war manufacturing was more important. Ever since, Vostroyans have pledged their **firstborn sons** to military service as recompense for their ancestors' refusal. Vostroyans are aristocratic, proud, and often equipped with rare or experimental weapons. They are politically sensitive—commanders must handle Vostroyan regiments carefully to avoid insulting their honor.

## Doctrine & Tactics: The Emperor's Hammer

Astra Militarum tactics emphasize **massed firepower and coordination** rather than individual heroism. A squad of 10 soldiers fighting as a coordinated unit can defeat special forces soldiers fighting individually—the disciplined application of suppressive fire, cover, and maneuver overwhelms individual skill. This extends to company, battalion, and army level: the Astra Militarum wins through organization, logistics, and overwhelming numbers.

Artillery is the Emperor's weapon of choice. A single Basilisk tank can level a city block. Multiple Basilisks coordinated by forward observers can annihilate entire enemy formations before ground troops even engage. Astra Militarum doctrine revolves around using artillery to break enemy cohesion, then advancing infantry to finish the job.

Tank companies and mechanized infantry provide mobile firepower. Heavy tanks like the Leman Russ (the primary Astra Militarum battle tank) can engage enemy formations at range, suppress enemy positions, and provide mobile cover for infantry advances. Without tank support, Astra Militarum regiments are vulnerable to mobile enemies.

Finally, **air support** from the Imperial Navy provides close air support in the form of Valkyrie gunships and fighter-bombers. A single Valkyrie can carry a full squad or provide suppressive fire from above. Regiments with air support routinely achieve victories against seemingly superior forces.

## The Common Soldier: Lasgun & Flak Armor

A typical Astra Militarum soldier is armed with a **lasgun**—a reliable, simple energy weapon that fires coherent plasma bolts. Lasguns have unlimited ammunition (powered by rechargeable packs), reliable operation in any environment, and adequate stopping power against light armor. They are not impressive individually, but in the hands of organized soldiers, they are devastatingly effective.

Armor consists of **flak jackets**—layered ceramic plates designed to stop shrapnel and light ballistics. Flak armor is not as advanced as Space Marine ceramite, but a soldier in flak armor is considerably harder to kill than a baseline human.

Officers and specialists carry **chainswords, bolt pistols, or plasma pistols**. Sergeants are marked by distinctive uniforms, insignia, and weapons that grant them leadership authority.

## Officers & Heroes

Astra Militarum officers—Colonels, Captains, and Generals—are among the most important figures in the Imperium. A single charismatic commander can inspire millions of soldiers to fight against impossible odds. Notable commanders include:

**Lord Commander Creed**: The legendary commander of Cadian forces, said to be descended from ancient generals and in possession of almost precognitive military acumen. Creed's tactical genius held Cadia against the 13th Black Crusade for months after the planet's formal defenses fell. His final fate is unclear—he held the rear guard until the end, and some whisper he yet lives in hidden service.

**Lord Castellan Ursula Creed**: The daughter of Creed, recently elevated to Lord Commander status. She represents a new generation of Astra Militarum officers.

**Grand Moff Haxley**: A controversial Militarum officer willing to use extreme tactics—including chemical weapons and civilians as shields—to achieve victory. Haxley represents the darker aspects of Astra Militarum culture.

**Colonel "Iron" Harker**: A Cadian survivor known for his refusal to surrender and uncanny survival. Harker leads the Last Cadian regiment.

## Logistics & Supply Chain

A critical but often-overlooked aspect of the Astra Militarum is its **logistical tail**. A regiment of 5,000 soldiers requires hundreds of support staff: medics, quartermasters, mechanics, cooks, drivers, and bureaucrats. The Astra Militarum's supply lines stretch across entire sectors, supplied by the Adeptus Mechanicus (who manufacture weapons and vehicles) and the Administratum (who manage supplies and personnel).

Loss of supply often spells the end for Astra Militarum forces—soldiers without ammunition or food will collapse regardless of morale. Conversely, forces with secure supply lines can sustain operations indefinitely. Astra Militarum strategy often revolves around securing supply routes and denying them to the enemy.

## Training & Recruitment

Most Astra Militarum soldiers are conscripted, though some volunteer. Young soldiers arrive at their regiment barely trained—basic rifle marksmanship, marching, and Imperial theology. Actual combat training happens on campaign. A soldier's first battle is often traumatic and frequently fatal, but survivors acquire combat experience that makes them exponentially more valuable.

The Astra Militarum's culture emphasizes that **duty to the Emperor is sacred**. Soldiers receive extensive religious education through the Adeptus Ministorum (the state church) and are taught that dying in the Emperor's service is the highest honor. This cultural conditioning produces soldiers willing to fight to the last, hold positions despite impossible odds, and sacrifice themselves to hold enemy forces in place while reinforcements arrive.

## Allies & Partnerships

The Astra Militarum operates alongside:

**Space Marines**: Astra Militarum soldiers hold positions and suppress enemies; Space Marines execute precise strikes that break enemy will. Where they work together, the combination is devastating.

**Adeptus Mechanicus**: Mars supplies weapons, vehicles, and technical expertise. Astra Militarum forces rely entirely on Mechanicus supply and maintenance.

**Imperial Navy**: Naval assets provide orbital support, transport, and close air support.

**Inquisition**: Inquisitors sometimes attach themselves to Astra Militarum forces to investigate threats or manage heresy.

**Adeptus Astartes**: Less common than Space Marines but occasionally Sisters of Battle fight alongside Guard regiments.

## Recent History: Cadia's Fall & After (M42)

For over 8,000 years, Cadia stood as the guardian of the Eye of Terror—a massive fortress world preventing Chaos incursions. When Abaddon the Despoiler launched his **13th Black Crusade**, Cadia was the first major target. The planet's defenses fell and the world was destroyed, collapsing the Cadian Gate and allowing Chaos forces to pour into the Imperium proper.

The fall of Cadia traumatized the Astra Militarum. For the first time in millennia, a major defensive position had been lost. Cadian regiments—the Imperium's elite—survived as fragments and refugees. Many Cadian survivors are now driven by either desire for redemption or desire for revenge, making them exceptionally dangerous in combat.

In the current era (M42), the Astra Militarum fights across two halves of a sundered galaxy. The **Cicatrix Maledictum** warp storm cut the Imperium in half, leaving the Astra Militarum on isolated frontiers without reinforcement. Many regiments have been fighting the same enemies for decades or centuries, grinding down casualties without relief.

Yet the Astra Militarum perseveres. New regiments are raised, trained, and deployed. Soldiers continue to die by the millions. The hammer continues to strike, even as it grows brittle.

## Conclusion

The Astra Militarum is the Imperium's greatest strength and its greatest vulnerability. Trillions of soldiers, billions of war machines, and centuries of accumulated tactical knowledge make them formidable. Yet they depend entirely on supply chains that can be disrupted, morale that can be broken, and logistical organization that can collapse. Lose the supply lines, and the Astra Militarum starves. Break the morale, and even the finest regiments dissolve. But as long as the Imperium stands, the Astra Militarum will march—disciplined, determined, and utterly expendable in service to the Emperor.
