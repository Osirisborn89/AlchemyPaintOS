# Harlequins - The Masque of the Laughing God

## Introduction

The Harlequins are Eldar warriors of a fundamentally different character from their Craftworld brethren. Where Craftworld Eldar seek to preserve their dying civilization through tradition and discipline, the Harlequins embrace chaos, change, and the fundamental unpredictability of existence. They are servants of **Cegorach**, the Laughing God, a Chaos God who embodies trickery, deception, and the power of the joke that kills. The Harlequins are not merely warriors or dancers—they are **theatrical performers of the most lethal kind**, traveling between worlds in their mysterious portable pocket dimensions called **Webway Nodes**, spreading elaborate plays and performances that are simultaneously art, prophecy, and military intelligence gathering. A Harlequin performance can last hours, can involve dozens of performers, and can simultaneously be a masterpiece of dramatic art and a devastating military incursion that destroys enemy command structures, assassinates key targets, and disappears before any meaningful response can be mounted. To face the Harlequins is to confront enemies who may not exist in any singular reality, who can strike from impossible angles, and whose true intentions may not become clear until long after the performance has ended and the audience—whether willing or unwilling—has been killed, converted, or fundamentally altered by the experience.

## Origins: Cegorach & The Dark Eldar Schism

### The Laughing God Among Chaos

Cegorach is unique among Chaos Gods in that He is believed to have existed before the Fall of the Eldar, before Slaanesh emerged from Warp excess, and possibly before the birth of the material universe itself. Where other Chaos Gods represent fundamental aspects of existence—excess, plague, ambition, rage—Cegorach represents something more abstract: the power of laughter, deception, and the joke that transcends all meaning.

Cegorach is the god of paradox. He is simultaneously a Chaos God and not a Chaos God. He demands worship and despises worship. He grants his servants power and abandons them to their fate. To understand Cegorach is to accept that understanding Cegorach is impossible.

### The Webway Escape

When Slaanesh was born from Eldar excess and tore through the Warp, the Eldar civilization was nearly destroyed. The Eldar sought escape through multiple paths: some retreated into Craftworlds, others embraced Chaos willingly, still others tried to hide in the Webway—an ancient network of interconnected tunnels through Warp space that predated even the Eldar civilization.

The Harlequins, as a distinct faction, emerged during the Fall as a response to a prophecy. Cegorach, it is said, appeared to Eldar survivors and offered them a choice: embrace the Laughing God's path of deception and performance, learn to exist in the spaces between reality, and survive through trickery and art rather than strength or honor. Some Eldar accepted.

Those who accepted became the first Harlequins. They learned to navigate the deepest levels of the Webway, to exist partially in multiple realities simultaneously, and to understand that survival meant abandoning any notion of fixed identity or purpose.

### The Masque Structure

The Harlequins organized themselves into **Masques**—semi-independent groups of performers, each with distinct theatrical traditions, distinct interpretations of Cegorach's teachings, and distinct aesthetic sensibilities. However, all Masques acknowledge an underlying unity: they serve Cegorach's grand design, even if that design is fundamentally unknowable.

Notable Masques include the **Midnight Sorrow**, the **Joyous Laugh**, the **Starlight Revels**, and others, each maintaining its own tradition and performance style while acknowledging the authority of the broader Harlequin collective.

## The Theology of Deception & Performance

### The Grand Performance

At the heart of Harlequin theology is the concept of **the Grand Performance**—the idea that all existence is a theatrical production, that all individuals are actors playing roles, and that the ultimate truth of the universe is a cosmic joke comprehensible only to Cegorach.

To the Harlequins, life is not struggle or suffering or even growth. Life is performance. Every action is a scene. Every conversation is dialogue. Every death is the final act of a character's story. From this perspective, attachment to outcome, fear of death, and concern for consequences are all failures of performance—failures to stay in character, failures to embrace the fundamental absurdity of existence.

### Deception as Sacred

The Harlequins teach that deception is not morally wrong but morally necessary. The universe is too complex, too layered, too absurd to be comprehended through simple truth. Only through layers of deception, misdirection, and carefully constructed illusions can one approach truth.

This leads to a paradoxical belief system: a Harlequin may tell you a complete lie while believing that lie conveys deeper truth than any conventional honest statement could. A Harlequin may promise aid and then betray you, secure in the knowledge that your betrayal was itself part of a larger truth that you could not have comprehended.

### The Audience & The Laugh

Central to Cegorach's theology is the concept of "the laugh"—the moment when the audience understands the joke. For Harlequins, this moment of understanding is often simultaneous with death. The enemy realizes, in their final moments, that they have been played, that the entire conflict was a performance, that they were audience members to their own destruction.

Some Harlequins seek to extend this moment. They will perform for days or weeks, allowing the enemy to gradually understand that the performance is happening, culminating in a final revelation that transforms the enemy's entire understanding of events.

## Biology & Transformation

### The Sacred Clown Virus

Harlequins are not born—they are made through exposure to a pathogen called the **Sacred Clown Virus**, a warp-based biological construct that fundamentally alters the exposed individual's perception of reality and grants certain superhuman capabilities.

The virus is part biological agent and part warp entity. It cannot be cured or removed. It can only be embraced. Those who embrace it undergo a fundamental transformation, becoming something more and less than their original selves.

### Perception Warping

A Harlequin's brain is altered to perceive probability, causality, and time in non-linear ways. A Harlequin can see multiple potential futures simultaneously. A Harlequin can perceive attacks that have not yet occurred. A Harlequin can move through space in ways that seem to violate physics because, to the Harlequin, the space they are moving through is understood as more fluid and negotiable than it appears to normal observers.

This perception warping is not fully controllable. A Harlequin sometimes becomes lost in alternate probability streams, uncertain which timeline they are currently existing in. Some Harlequins deliberately maintain multiple existences simultaneously across different timelines.

### Enhanced Physical Capability

Beyond perception warping, Harlequins undergo physical enhancement. They develop superhuman speed and agility. Their reflexes approach precognitive levels. Their bodies become capable of dramatic acrobatic feats that seem to defy gravity or conventional physics.

A Harlequin can fall from orbital height and survive. A Harlequin can move faster than normal eyes can follow. A Harlequin can maintain balance on surfaces that should not support human weight.

### Warp Affinity & Pocket Dimensions

The most significant transformation is Harlequin capacity to interact with Warp space directly. Harlequins can create temporary pocket dimensions, can step sideways out of normal space, and can traverse the Webway without the specialized technology required of other Eldar.

This means Harlequins can appear and disappear at will. They can emerge from inside enemies' defenses. They can vanish when confronted with overwhelming force. They can exist partially in Warp space and partially in material space simultaneously, making them difficult to target or harm.

## Organization: Masques & The Grand Theater

### The Masque Structure

Each Harlequin Masque is a semi-independent theatrical troupe numbering typically 20-100 performers. Each Masque maintains its own aesthetic, its own interpretation of Cegorach's teachings, and its own performance repertoire.

However, all Masques are coordinated through mysterious means believed to involve direct communication with Cegorach or his representatives. When one Masque performs, all other Masques seem to understand the performance's implications and adjust their own activities accordingly.

### The Solitaire

Beyond the Masques exist **Solitaires**—individual Harlequins who have rejected the collective structure and now wander alone, performing private plays for unknown audiences. Solitaires are considered to be directly blessed by Cegorach and are treated with respect verging on fear even by other Harlequins.

A Solitaire may suddenly appear in the midst of a conflict, perform alone against overwhelming odds, accomplish objectives that should be impossible, and then vanish. Other Harlequins will interpret the Solitaire's performance as prophecy or as Cegorach's direct intervention in events.

### The Dark Pyramid & Hierarchy

Despite the apparent chaos and decentralization of Harlequin organization, evidence suggests the existence of a hidden hierarchy called the **Dark Pyramid** or the **Pyramid of Truth**. This hierarchy is said to consist of the oldest and most skilled Harlequins, those who have mastered the deepest levels of Cegorach's teachings.

Whether this hierarchy actually exists or is itself a performance meant to mislead is fundamentally unknowable.

## Arsenal & Performance Props

### The Death Jester's Arsenal

Harlequins carry weapons that are simultaneously practical and theatrical. A Harlequin's weapon might appear to be a simple dance prop—a ribbon, a fan, a mirror—but functions as a deadly weapon capable of slicing through power armor or deflecting incoming fire.

Common Harlequin weapons include:

- **The Embrace**: A whip-like weapon capable of entangling and disarming enemies
- **The Caress**: Blade weapons of exotic design, often used with multiple simultaneous strikes
- **The Laugh**: Pistol-like weapons firing warp-distorted projectiles
- **The Performance**: Larger weapons deployed by specialized Harlequin performers

### The Webway Portal

Harlequins carry portable Webway portals called **Webway Gates** or **Shuriken Cannons** (when configured as ranged weapons). These devices allow Harlequins to create temporary passages through the Webway, allowing rapid deployment of additional performers or rapid escape from overwhelming force.

### Relic Armor & Costume

Each Harlequin's costume and armor is simultaneously practical protection and elaborate theatrical costume. The costume serves multiple functions: it provides protection comparable to conventional power armor, it allows the Harlequin to blend into crowds or environments, and it communicates the Harlequin's role within the performance.

The colors, symbols, and design of Harlequin costumes convey information to other performers about the current performance's nature, the Harlequin's intended role, and the expected outcome of the performance.

## Combat Doctrine: The Theatrical Assault

### The Performance as Warfare

Harlequin combat doctrine is not organized around conventional military principles. Instead, it is organized around the concept of the performance. An engagement with Harlequins should be understood as a theatrical production with specific acts, dramatic pacing, and an intended narrative arc.

The first act typically involves misdirection—the Harlequins will engage the enemy in ways that suggest weakness or vulnerability, allowing the enemy to believe they have an advantage. The second act involves the revelation—the Harlequins will suddenly shift their tactics, revealing that they possess capabilities and knowledge the enemy did not anticipate. The third act involves the climax—a sudden, overwhelming assault that eliminates enemy leadership or achieves objectives.

Throughout the performance, the Harlequins maintain theatrical aesthetic. They move like dancers. They gesture theatrically. They sometimes pause mid-combat to deliver monologues or recite poetry. To the uninitiated observer, the performance appears chaotic and undisciplined. In reality, every movement serves a purpose.

### Assassination & Decapitation

Harlequins specialize in assassination and the elimination of enemy leadership. A Harlequin force will often ignore massed enemy troops and target the enemy's most valuable individuals. A general, a commander, a key leader—these are the true targets of a Harlequin performance.

This focus on decapitation means that defeating a Harlequin force does not require destroying all the performers. It requires identifying the actual objective of the performance and protecting that objective. Unfortunately, the Harlequins are masters at disguising their true objectives until it is too late.

### Webway Mobility

Harlequins exploit their ability to move through the Webway to achieve impossible tactical positions. They can appear behind enemy lines. They can emerge from inside fortifications. They can strike from multiple directions simultaneously using pocket dimensions.

This mobility makes conventional defensive positions nearly useless. An enemy can fortify and prepare, only to have Harlequins emerge from unexpected locations and accomplish objectives before conventional response is possible.

### The Grand Finale

Harlequin performances typically conclude with a grand finale—a moment of maximum theatrical impact where the performance's true meaning becomes clear. This might involve a sudden withdrawal, a mass assassination, or a seemingly impossible escape. The grand finale is designed to be remembered, to be misunderstood, and to shape how subsequent events are interpreted.

## Notable Harlequins & Solitaires

### Shadowseer Kael Invocatus

A legendary Shadowseer (a Harlequin specialist in prophecy and warp manipulation) who orchestrated the fall of an entire Chaos warband through a performance that lasted six months and involved hundreds of individual scenes.

### The Laughing God's Chosen

A mysterious Solitaire whose performances are so complex that other Harlequins spend years attempting to understand their meaning. Some believe this Solitaire is a direct incarnation of Cegorach in material form.

### The Black Jester

A rogue Harlequin who has begun performing independently, creating chaos in regions where other Harlequins planned orderly destruction. Whether the Black Jester is a heretic or is performing an even deeper role in Cegorach's grand design is unknown.

## Recent History: M42 & The Dawning Comedy

In the current era, Harlequin activity has increased dramatically. Performances that were once separated by centuries now occur monthly. Masques that were once isolated are coordinating with unprecedented precision.

Some theorists suggest that Cegorach is orchestrating a grand performance of galactic scope—a performance in which all factions, all individuals, and all events are players in a cosmic theatrical production leading to a predetermined conclusion.

The implications of this possibility are terrifying: if all events are predetermined performance, then victory and defeat are theatrical roles, survival and death are narrative arcs, and free will is merely performance within a script written by the Laughing God.

## Weaknesses & Limitations

### Unpredictability

Harlequin unpredictability makes them difficult to counter, but it also makes them unreliable allies. A Harlequin may suddenly change objectives mid-performance, abandoning objectives that seemed paramount.

### Limited Numbers

Harlequins are rare. An entire Masque may number fewer than 100 individuals. This limits their ability to conduct large-scale operations. They excel at assassination and targeted strikes but struggle to hold territory or conduct sustained campaigns.

### Warp Dependency

Harlequins are dependent on access to the Webway and stable warp space. In regions where the warp is chaotic or where the Webway is damaged, Harlequins lose their mobility advantage and become vulnerable to conventional military response.

### Performance Obsession

Harlequins' obsession with performance sometimes causes them to take unnecessary risks or to pursue objectives that seem militarily illogical but align with dramatic narrative. This can be exploited by enemies who understand that Harlequins are sometimes willing to lose battles to achieve better theatrical effect.

## Conclusion

The Harlequins represent the Eldar civilization's most alien and most powerful faction. They are not warriors seeking victory but performers seeking to execute a cosmic theatrical production. To oppose the Harlequins is not to oppose a military force but to oppose fate itself, to resist the inevitable unfolding of a script that may have been written millennia ago by forces completely beyond human comprehension.

In the grim darkness of the far future, the Harlequins dance between the stars, performing plays of such complexity and beauty that their audiences die without understanding they have been performance venues all along.
