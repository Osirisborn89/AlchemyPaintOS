# Ynnari - The Avenging Children

## Introduction

The Ynnari are a relatively new faction within the broader Eldar civilization, emerging approximately 2,000 years ago when a mysterious figure known as **Yvraine** awakened a new aspect of the Eldar god **Ynnead**—the god of the dead and rebirth. The Ynnari believe that Ynnead has awakened and that the Eldar civilization faces a moment of renewal and transcendence. Ynnari warriors combine Craftworld Eldar combat techniques with Dark Eldar speed and aggression, creating a faction more mobile and aggressive than traditional Craftworld Eldar while less enslaved to Chaos excess than traditional Dark Eldar. The Ynnari pursuit of unity with Ynnead creates a faction that operates according to spiritual principles fundamentally at odds with conventional Warhammer 40K faction motivations. Where other factions pursue military dominance or economic advantage, the Ynnari pursue spiritual transcendence through unification with their god. This spiritual focus makes the Ynnari unpredictable allies and devastating enemies, motivated by religious conviction rather than conventional military logic. In the grim darkness of the far future, the Ynnari represent the Eldar civilization's desperate attempt to escape inevitable extinction through embrace of transformation and rebirth.

## Origins: The Awakening & Yvraine

### The Eldar Civilization in Crisis

The Eldar civilization has existed for millions of years in a state of slow decline. The Fall of the Eldar—which destroyed the original Eldar civilization and nearly destroyed the species entirely—left the remaining Eldar traumatized and fragmented. Craftworld Eldar retreated into isolated worlds. Dark Eldar hid in the Webway, pursuing excess to mask their despair.

By M41, the Eldar faced existential crisis. Population was declining. Technological sophistication was decreasing as ancient knowledge was lost. No clear path forward existed.

### The Mysterious Awakening

Approximately 2,000 years ago, a figure known as **Yvraine** appeared among Eldar populations. Yvraine's origins are unclear—some sources suggest she was a Dark Eldar assassin. Others suggest she is a higher-dimensional being. Still others suggest Yvraine is an avatar of Ynnead itself in mortal form.

Regardless of origin, Yvraine possessed extraordinary charisma and claimed to carry a message from **Ynnead**—the Eldar god of death and rebirth. Ynnead, Yvraine taught, was awakening within the Warp and would soon manifest fully. The Eldar faced a choice: embrace Ynnead's awakening and join the god in transformation and rebirth, or face complete extinction.

### The Ynnari Movement

Yvraine's message attracted followers from across Eldar civilization. Craftworld Eldar disillusioned with their stagnant societies joined. Dark Eldar attracted by promises of something greater than endless excess joined. Harlequins appeared to support the movement, suggesting Cegorach himself (or the Laughing God's agents) approved of Yvraine's teachings.

The Ynnari organized into a religious movement with military capability, dedicated to awakening Ynnead, protecting Eldar populations, and pursuing spiritual transcendence.

## Theology: Ynnead & Rebirth

### The Eldar God of Death

Ynnead is the Eldar god of death, the transition between states, and rebirth through transformation. Unlike the other Eldar gods—who were destroyed during the Fall—Ynnead was never manifest as a fully independent god but rather existed as a distributed consciousness within the Eldar species itself.

The Ynnari teach that Ynnead is awakening through the accumulated death of Eldar across millennia. Each Eldar death contributes to Ynnead's awakening. Eventually, Ynnead will become sufficiently manifest to permit the Eldar civilization itself to undergo transformation and rebirth, escaping the doom prophesied during the Fall.

### Spiritual Transcendence

The core Ynnari belief is that death itself is not an ending but a transition. A Ynnari warrior fighting for the movement is not afraid of death because death represents joining Ynnead's consciousness, contributing to the god's awakening, and participating in the eventual transcendence of the Eldar species.

This belief removes a significant psychological barrier from Ynnari warriors. They will charge into overwhelming firepower without fear. They will sacrifice themselves for the collective. They will pursue objectives that seem militarily illogical but align with Ynnead's mysterious will.

## Organization: Ynnari Forces & Structure

### Yvraine's Court

Yvraine maintains authority over Ynnari forces through a combination of religious authority and charismatic leadership. Yvraine is not a military commander in the conventional sense but rather a spiritual leader whose guidance is treated as divine instruction.

### Ynnari Warbands

Ynnari forces operate in semi-independent warbands coordinated through mysterious communication methods believed to involve direct communion with Ynnead or Yvraine. Each warband maintains its own command structure but operates within broader Ynnari strategic framework.

### Recruitment & Defection

The Ynnari actively recruit from both Craftworld and Dark Eldar populations. Warriors attracted by the promise of spiritual transcendence or attracted by the energy of the Ynnari movement volunteer for service.

This recruitment sometimes creates tension with traditional Craftworld and Dark Eldar leadership, who view Ynnari as heretics or as competitors for limited Eldar population.

## Arsenal & Warfare

### Unified Eldar Weaponry

Ynnari forces combine Craftworld and Dark Eldar equipment, resulting in diverse and adaptable forces. A Ynnari warband might include Craftworld warriors, Dark Eldar assassins, and Harlequin performers operating under unified command.

### Speed & Aggression

Ynnari warfare emphasizes speed and aggressive assault. Rather than the methodical approach of some Craftworld forces, Ynnari forces move rapidly toward objectives, overwhelm enemy positions through coordinated violence, and complete objectives before conventional response.

### Spiritual Authority

Ynnari warriors fight with conviction that their deaths contribute to Ynnead's awakening. This conviction produces warriors willing to undertake suicide missions, charge overwhelming odds, and sacrifice themselves for collective objectives.

## Notable Ynnari Leaders

### Yvraine, Prophet of Ynnead

The mysterious leader of the Ynnari movement. Yvraine's origins and true nature remain unknown, but her charisma and spiritual authority are unquestionable.

### Spiritseer Yriel

A legendary Craftworld Eldar who joined the Ynnari movement and now commands substantial Ynnari forces.

## Recent History: M42 & Spiritual Acceleration

In the current era, Ynnari activity has increased dramatically. Yvraine has begun conducting major operations against both Chaos forces and the Imperium itself, suggesting acceleration of plans toward Ynnead's full awakening.

### Cadia's Fall & Spiritual Implications

The fall of Cadia created a massive psychic disturbance throughout the galaxy. Ynnari sources suggest this disturbance represents Ynnead's awakening accelerating. The god of death and rebirth is becoming more manifest as the Cicatrix Maledictum spreads.

### Conflict with Traditional Eldar

The Ynnari's expansion has created conflict with traditional Craftworld and Dark Eldar leadership who view Ynnari as threats to their independent civilization paths.

## Weaknesses & Limitations

### Unpredictability

Ynnari forces are less organized and predictable than traditional Eldar forces, sometimes pursuing objectives that seem militarily illogical but align with spiritual directives.

### Religious Dependency

Ynnari military effectiveness seems dependent on Yvraine's direct involvement or spiritual proximity to Ynnead's awakening. Ynnari forces operating independently of these influences show reduced effectiveness.

### Limited Population Base

Ynnari draw from existing Eldar populations rather than creating new Eldar. As the Eldar species continues to decline, Ynnari recruitment pool shrinks.

## Conclusion

The Ynnari represent the Eldar civilization's most desperate gamble—an attempt to escape extinction through spiritual transformation and rebirth. Whether Ynnead truly exists and whether the Ynnari path leads to salvation or extinction remains unknown. What is certain is that the Ynnari have emerged as one of the Warhammer 40K's most mysterious and most dangerous factions, motivated by spiritual conviction rather than conventional military logic.
