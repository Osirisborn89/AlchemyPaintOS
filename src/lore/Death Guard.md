# Death Guard - The Plague God's Chosen

## Introduction

The Death Guard are a Space Marine Legion turned Chaos warband, transformed from the disciplined soldiers of the Imperium into plague-ridden apostles of decay and corruption. Once commanded by Primarch **Mortarion**, they were among the Emperor's finest—a Legion known for their resilience, their ability to endure impossible conditions, and their unwavering loyalty. Yet the Horus Heresy shattered that loyalty. Mortarion, seduced by Chaos and broken by his belief that the Emperor had abandoned him, led his Legion into damnation. In the ten thousand years since, the Death Guard have become something far worse than mere traitors. They are the servants of **Nurgle**, the Chaos God of decay, disease, and endless suffering. Every Death Guard warrior carries within their corrupted body the weight of countless plagues, the infection of the warp itself, and the terrible knowledge that they can never truly die—for Nurgle does not permit his servants the mercy of death. They are immortal in their degradation, eternal in their corruption, walking petri dishes of biological and supernatural horror. To face the Death Guard is not merely to face skilled warriors, but to face the inevitable triumph of entropy itself.

## Origins: The XIV Legion & Mortarion's Fall

### The Dusk Raiders - Honorable Beginnings

The Legion that would become the Death Guard was originally designated the **XIV Legion**, called the **Dusk Raiders**. They were a Legion born from Terra's harshest environments, recruited from the ash wastelands and poison-choked industrial zones where only the most resilient could survive. These early Death Guard were not bred for glory or conquest. They were bred to endure.

When the Emperor discovered their Primarch, **Mortarion**, on the world of Barbarus, the Legion was renamed to honor his origins and his fierce commitment to seeing every mission through to completion, no matter the cost. Mortarion brought a new philosophy to the XIV Legion: discipline, stoicism, and the acceptance that some battles could not be won—only endured.

### Mortarion: The Pale King

**Mortarion** was a warrior-philosopher who believed that the Emperor represented the promise of humanity's future—a golden age of reason, strength, and defiance against the darkness. Unlike some Primarchs who pursued glory or conquest, Mortarion sought to build something lasting, something that would endure long after the initial conquest was complete.

During the Great Crusade, the Death Guard earned a reputation as the Legion that would fight in the most toxic, disease-ridden, and hostile environments. Mortarion led them personally into hive worlds choked with chemical pollutants, into plague-stricken civilizations, into the heart of xenos bioweapons. The Death Guard did not retreat when exposed to toxins that would kill normal humans in seconds. They adapted, endured, and conquered.

This reputation for resilience came with a cost. Mortarion became increasingly bitter about the Emperor's distant leadership. When the Emperor did not come personally to reward the Death Guard for their countless victories, Mortarion interpreted this as abandonment. When the Emperor did not explain His grand strategy, Mortarion saw only autocracy and indifference. These resentments festered.

### The Horus Heresy & Corruption

When the Horus Heresy erupted, Mortarion was torn between his loyalty to the Emperor and his growing belief that the Emperor had failed humanity. The Warmaster Horus, himself corrupted by Chaos, approached Mortarion and offered a choice: join the rebellion against an Emperor who had abandoned him, or remain loyal to a failing regime.

Mortarion was vulnerable. He was proud, resentful, and convinced that the Emperor had dismissed him. Horus preyed on these weaknesses, presenting corruption not as damnation but as liberation—freedom from the Emperor's tyranny, freedom to pursue Mortarion's own vision for humanity's future.

The choice destroyed him. Mortarion fell to Chaos not through sudden corruption but through a slow erosion of faith. And as he fell, he brought the Death Guard with him.

### The Warp's Embrace & Nurgle's Gift

When the Death Guard formally entered the service of Chaos during the Horus Heresy, they were exposed to forces beyond mortal comprehension. Warp entities, daemons, and the raw entropy of the Immaterium flooded into their minds and bodies. Many died. But Mortarion and his elite did not. Instead, they were **changed**.

They were touched by **Nurgle**, the Chaos God of disease, decay, and entropy. Nurgle did not destroy them—instead, He transformed them into His chosen servants. Mortarion himself ascended to become a Daemon Prince, a god-like entity of horrifying power. The Death Guard, his followers, were remade in the image of their god. Plague and disease became not curses but blessings. Rot became strength. Corruption became immortality.

In the current age, the Death Guard serve Nurgle absolutely. They do not serve Chaos in general or pursue individual ambition. They serve the Plague God because serving Nurgle means they can never truly be destroyed, never truly fail, never truly cease to exist. In Nurgle's garden, even failure grows into something beautiful.

## The Theology of Decay

### Nurgle's Gift & The Garden Eternal

The Death Guard's theology centers on the absolute certainty that all things decay, all things rot, and all things eventually fall apart. This is not seen as tragedy but as the fundamental truth of existence—and therefore, a source of comfort rather than despair.

Nurgle teaches that decay is not the opposite of creation but its complement. When something rots, it breaks down into constituent parts. Those parts become the soil for new life. Decay is recycling. Decay is transformation. Decay is natural, inevitable, and ultimately merciful because it ends all suffering through the simple expedient of ending all things.

To the Death Guard, Nurgle is not a tyrant demanding worship but a **loving father** who offers his children the greatest gift: **immortality through transformation**. A Death Guard warrior does not fear death because he will not die in any conventional sense. His body may be ravaged by plague, consumed by disease, reduced to a shambling husk—but he will continue to function. Nurgle's gifts ensure that.

### The Garden of Nurgle

Nurgle's realm in the Warp is often described as an endless garden—diseased, putrefying, hideous by any conventional aesthetic standard, yet paradoxically beautiful in its own horrifying way. The Death Guard believe that after their service ends, their souls will bloom in Nurgle's garden, becoming part of the infinite tapestry of decay and transformation.

This belief removes a critical psychological barrier from the Death Guard. They do not fear corruption because corruption is the path to salvation. They do not fear plague because plague is how Nurgle marks them as chosen. They do not fear mutation because mutation is how Nurgle sculpts them into ever more perfect servants.

### Disease as Sacrament

Every plague carried by the Death Guard is treated as a **sacrament**, a holy thing. When a Death Guard warrior contracts a new disease or develops a new infection, he does not seek cure. He celebrates. The plague is Nurgle's blessing, proof that he remains chosen, proof that Nurgle has not forgotten him.

This creates a theological inversion of Imperial faith. Where Sisters of Battle fight to preserve the purity of faith, Death Guard warriors celebrate the glory of infection. Where the Imperium treats disease as enemy, the Death Guard treat disease as gift.

## Biology: The Plague Incarnate

### Corruption of the Gene-Seed

The Death Guard's bodies have been corrupted at a fundamental level. Their gene-seed—the genetic template passed to their successors—has been warped by Chaos and Nurgle's blessing. A Death Guard Space Marine is already superhuman in the way all Space Marines are, but he is additionally **plague-touched**.

Every Death Guard carries within his body multiple diseases, infections, and corruptions that would destroy a normal human in seconds. These are not accidental infections—they are deliberate enhancements, cultivated and nurtured by the Death Guard themselves. A Death Guard warrior will deliberately infect himself with exotic plagues to gain their benefits.

### Resilience & Regeneration

The primary "benefit" of Death Guard corruption is near-total resilience to damage. A Death Guard warrior shot through the chest will not die—his body will simply keep moving, kept animated by Nurgle's blessing and the sheer biological redundancy of his corrupted physiology. Limbs blown off will not impair his function. Organs destroyed will be replaced by cancerous growths that serve the same purpose, if not better.

This resilience is not natural or explainable through conventional biology. It is warp-based corruption made flesh. A Death Guard exists in a state of perpetual dying that never quite reaches completion. He is simultaneously alive and dead, functioning and decaying, sustained by Nurgle's power rather than conventional biology.

### Psychic Resistance & Warp Affinity

The Death Guard are naturally resistant to psychic assault and daemonic possession. Ironically, this is because they are already so corrupted that daemon entities cannot gain additional purchase on their minds. A Death Guard's consciousness is already so suffused with warp energy that adding more simply reinforces what is already there.

However, the Death Guard are not immune to psychic effects so much as **displaced** by them. Psychic attacks meant for normal humans glance off a Death Guard because there is not sufficient intact humanity remaining to target. Attempts to possess a Death Guard typically fail because there is no singular consciousness to displace—only a chorus of warp-touched corruption.

## Organization: Warbands & The Plague Fleet

The Death Guard do not maintain the rigid hierarchical structure of the Imperium or even most Chaos warbands. Instead, they organize into **Plague Companies** and **Warbands**, each with semi-autonomous command structure but all answering ultimately to **Mortarion** and the will of Nurgle.

### Mortarion the Daemon Prince

**Mortarion** rules the Death Guard as an absolute authority, yet paradoxically, he is not a tyrant in the conventional sense. He commands because the Death Guard *want* to follow him. His will is perceived as aligned with Nurgle's will, and therefore his commands are seen as divine instructions rather than oppressive mandates.

As a Daemon Prince, Mortarion possesses power approaching godhood. He can manifest his will across millions of followers simultaneously, kill with a thought, and exist in multiple places at once. He is effectively immortal in any meaningful sense—if killed, he simply reforms in the warp and returns.

### Plague Companies

The Death Guard organize into companies of typically 100-200 warriors, each with a commander called a **Lord of Contagion**. These lords maintain some autonomy but operate within broader strategic frameworks established by Mortarion.

Each plague company specializes in different aspects of warfare. Some are heavily armored assault troops. Others specialize in ranged firepower. Still others specialize in psychological warfare and the cultivation of disease.

### The Plague Fleet

The Death Guard operate a substantial warp-based fleet called the **Plague Fleet**, composed of corrupted naval vessels, daemon ships, and bio-organic craft grown from Nurgle's blessings. These ships do not follow conventional physics or naval doctrine. They move through space in ways that seem to violate causality, sometimes appearing in the same location for weeks as if drifting, then suddenly vanishing and appearing light-years away.

The flagship of the Plague Fleet is **the Terminus**, a massive daemon ship that serves as Mortarion's mobile headquarters. Aboard the Terminus, the boundaries between real and warp space are profoundly blurred. Time does not flow normally. Space folds in ways that geometry should not permit. To walk the corridors of the Terminus is to risk madness.

## Arsenal & Wargear

### The Manreaper

**Mortarion's** personal weapon is the **Manreaper**, a massive scythe-halberd of ancient design fused with daemonic power. The weapon drinks blood and drains life force with every strike. Legends claim that the Manreaper has killed billions and that every death ever dealt by the blade leaves a psychic imprint within the weapon.

### Death Guard Weaponry

Death Guard warriors carry a mix of **corrupted Imperial weaponry** and **plague-based biological weapons**. Many Death Guard favor boltguns modified to fire shells carrying infectious agents rather than conventional explosives. A hit from a Death Guard boltgun is often fatal not from the impact but from the infection that follows.

Plasma guns are corrupted to fire sickly green plasma infused with Nurgle's essence. These weapons are incredibly dangerous—even friendly fire from another Death Guard is treated as acceptable collateral if it spreads disease. Meltaguns and flamers are modified to project streams of corrupted acid or mutagenic flame rather than conventional melta or fire.

Many Death Guard carry weapons grown from their own bodies or cultivated in plague vats. Spore cloud projectors, acid-spray mutations, diseased tentacle appendages—anything that can spread infection is a weapon.

### Plague Marine Armor

Death Guard power armor is utterly corrupted, covered in pustules, weeping with infected discharge, and decorated with the symbols of Nurgle. The armor itself is alive in ways that conventional technology is not. It can heal damage. It can grow new components. It can birth plague-ridden offspring.

A Death Guard warrior's armor is often more dangerous than his weapons. Simply standing near a Death Guard can expose an enemy to airborne pathogens. Physical contact is almost always fatal due to the sheer concentration of disease.

### Vehicles of Plague

The Death Guard field corrupted Imperial vehicles. Predators are transformed into mobile plague dispensaries, firing shells full of infectious agents. Rhinos are converted into mobile contagion centers. Defilers are massive daemon-like vehicles combining mechanical and biological components. Plagueburst Crawlers are dedicated plague-spreading platforms—massive, slow-moving, but absolutely devastating in their ability to saturate an area with disease.

## Combat Doctrine: The Plague Onslaught

### Patience & Inevitability

Death Guard combat doctrine is fundamentally different from other Chaos forces. Where the Black Legion pursues swift, crushing victory, and the Emperor's Children seek sensation and excess, the Death Guard understand that they have **infinite patience**.

Death Guard warfare often involves establishing plague beachheads and then slowly, inexorably spreading disease across entire regions. They may siege a world for years, centuries even, simply infecting and re-infecting populations until resistance collapses not from military defeat but from disease-induced collapse.

### Psychological Warfare

The very existence of the Death Guard is a psychological weapon. To see a Death Guard warrior—rotting, diseased, barely held together by warp power—is to confront the possibility that one's own death may not be the end. It may be the beginning of an eternal existence of suffering.

Many enemies facing the Death Guard break psychologically before physical contact is made. The knowledge that conventional weapons may not stop them, that conventional tactics may not work, that they may be forced to endure an infection that ensures slow death—this breaks morale.

### Melee Dominance

Despite their slow movement and seemingly cumbersome design, Death Guard warriors are devastating in melee combat. The combination of superhuman strength, near-invulnerability, and the psychological horror of their presence makes them nearly unstoppable in close quarters.

Many Death Guard deliberately move slowly to their objectives, allowing themselves to be surrounded, before exploding into violence. An enemy believing they have an advantage is disabused of the notion when their attacks fail to slow the Death Guard advance.

## Notable Death Guard Leaders & Figures

### Mortarion, The Daemon Prince

The supreme commander of the Death Guard. Once a proud warrior loyal to the Emperor, Mortarion is now a god-like entity of plague and decay. He commands the Death Guard's overall strategy but rarely engages personally in warfare, content to orchestrate larger movements.

### Typhus the Traveller

The Champion of Nurgle among the Death Guard. Typhus is Mortarion's lieutenant and is believed to possess an entire plague god's worth of disease within his body. Typhus is obsessed with spreading Nurgle's gift to all the galaxy, and his personal vendetta against the Imperium has resulted in dozens of infected worlds.

### Lord Felthius

A Lord of Contagion who specializes in corrupting other warriors. Felthius has personally converted hundreds of Space Marines to Nurgle's service through a combination of ideology and forced infection. He commands plague companies with ruthless efficiency and has earned a reputation for never failing in his objectives—he either succeeds or remains in place until he does.

### Nauseous Rotty

A lesser Death Guard figure but one of significant notoriety. Nauseous Rotty is a barely-sane warrior whose body has been so corrupted that he barely remembers his original name or identity. He is perpetually confused, prone to rambling, yet inexplicably effective in combat. Some believe Rotty is the conduit through which Nurgle most directly manifests in physical form.

## Recent History: M42 & The Plague Endless

In the current era, the Death Guard have become more active in the galaxy than they have been in thousands of years. The Cicatrix Maledictum has disrupted Imperial communications, making it difficult to coordinate defensive responses to plague incursions.

### The Plague Wars

Multiple Death Guard warbands have launched coordinated assaults on Imperial worlds, not with the goal of conquest but with the goal of infection. Entire sectors have fallen not to military defeat but to plague. The Imperium now faces the horrifying prospect that many of its "lost" worlds are not destroyed but **infected**, home to Death Guard armies and populations transformed into disease carriers.

### The Zombie Legions

One of the Death Guard's most horrifying tactics in M42 is the cultivation of infected populations. A conquered world is not destroyed but preserved and systematically exposed to Death Guard plagues. The population becomes sick but not dead, transformed into vectors for disease. These infected populations are then deployed as biological weapons against other worlds.

### Alliance with Mortarion's Will

Recent theological developments among the Death Guard suggest increasing unity around Mortarion's strategic vision. Rather than individual warbands pursuing localized goals, the Death Guard appear to be consolidating under a unified command structure. This consolidation is terrifying because it suggests that Mortarion has decided on a galaxy-wide campaign rather than mere regional expansion.

## Weaknesses & Limitations

### Slowness & Logistics

Death Guard warfare is slow. They do not pursue swift victory. This creates opportunities for enemies to regroup, reorganize, and establish defensive positions. Additionally, Death Guard forces are somewhat dependent on logistics—they require time to cultivate plagues and spread disease.

### Limited Ranged Effectiveness

While Death Guard have ranged weapons, they are not as devastating as some other military forces. Their strength lies in close quarters and in the spread of disease over time rather than in firepower concentration.

### Arrogance & Complacency

The Death Guard's knowledge that they can never truly be destroyed sometimes leads to arrogance. They may underestimate enemies, fail to pursue objectives aggressively, or become complacent when facing determined opposition.

### Vulnerability to Radical Anti-Chaos Measures

While the Death Guard are resistant to conventional weapons and tactics, specialized anti-Chaos measures can harm them. Weapons sanctified by the Emperor, psychic powers wielded by powerful psykers, and certain xenos technologies have proven effective against Death Guard forces.

## Aesthetic & Culture

The Death Guard embrace a grotesque aesthetic of decay and corruption. Their armor is deliberately maintained in a state of advanced degradation. Their vehicles are decorated with bones, infected organic matter, and symbols of Nurgle. Their fortress bases are surrounded by plague gardens—areas of absolute biological corruption where only the most hardy organisms can survive.

Death Guard culture celebrates suffering, endurance, and the acceptance of inevitable decay. They do not pursue beauty or glory—they pursue the perfection of corruption.

## Conclusion

The Death Guard represent one of the Imperium's most horrifying threats not because they are the strongest warriors (though they are formidable), but because they represent a fundamental inversion of Imperial values. Where the Imperium fights to preserve life and order, the Death Guard embrace death and decay. Where the Imperium pursues eternity through the Emperor's divine protection, the Death Guard achieve immortality through Nurgle's corruption.

In the grim darkness of the far future, the Death Guard march slowly but inevitably, spreading plague and decay, confident that eventually all things will succumb to entropy. They are Nurgle's chosen, Mortarion's champions, and the living proof that the greatest curse is not death but the inability to die.
