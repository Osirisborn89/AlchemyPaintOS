# Emperor's Children - Slaanesh's Obsession

## Introduction

The **Emperor's Children** were once the finest warriors in the Imperium—the most technically skilled, the most beautifully equipped, the most perfect in every measurable way. They were a legion of artists and warriors combined, pursuing excellence in all things.

Yet this very pursuit of perfection became their damnation. **Slaanesh**, the Chaos God of excess, seduced them through their own virtues—transforming their desire for perfection into hunger for excess, their artistic sensibilities into grotesque obsession, their martial excellence into sadistic delight.

The Emperor's Children represent the tragedy of corruption through perverted virtue: they did not fall to Chaos through weakness, but through the amplification of their greatest strengths.

## Origins: Fulgrim the Flawless (M30)

### The Perfection Primarch

**Fulgrim** was discovered as the most physically and intellectually perfect of all the Primarchs—a being of such beauty and skill that to merely look upon him inspired admiration. Unlike other Primarchs who came from harsh worlds, Fulgrim came from a civilized world where arts, philosophy, and craftsmanship were valued.

More critically, Fulgrim was born with a **fundamental flaw in his psyche**: an obsession with perfection so complete that it bordered on pathological. Every aspect of his being was devoted to achieving absolute perfection in all endeavors.

### The III Legion's Excellence

The legion that Fulgrim inherited excelled in all areas:

- **Combat prowess**: Rivaling even the Space Wolves in martial skill
- **Craftsmanship**: Producing weapons and armor of superior quality
- **Discipline**: Operating with perfect coordination and precision
- **Innovation**: Constantly seeking improvements and refinements

Fulgrim amplified these traits, creating a legion dedicated to achieving perfection in every action.

## The Seduction: The Sword of Perfection (Pre-Heresy)

### The Weapon & The Curse

During an expedition, **Fulgrim recovered an ancient xenos sword**—a weapon of such perfect craftsmanship that it seemed to embody perfection itself.

However, the sword contained a **daemonic entity** devoted to Slaanesh. The entity began to whisper to Fulgrim, gradually seducing him:

- **Flattering his perfectionism**: Suggesting that perfection could be achieved through embracing chaos and excess
- **Offering power**: Promising that through Slaanesh's blessings, Fulgrim could transcend human limitations
- **Corrupting philosophy**: Slowly shifting Fulgrim's desire for perfection into desire for sensation and excess

### The Corruption Begins

Before the Heresy even occurred, the Emperor's Children were beginning their fall:

- **Experimental improvements**: Pushing the boundaries of what Space Marines could become
- **Sensory enhancement**: Adding modifications that enhanced perception and sensation
- **Sonic weaponry development**: Creating weapons that weaponized sound itself
- **Aesthetic obsession**: Decorating equipment with increasingly grotesque art

The legion was slowly being corrupted from within, unaware that their greatest desire was being weaponized against them.

## The Fall: The Heresy's Embrace (M31)

### The Final Seduction

When **Horus** revealed his treachery and called the legions to join him, Fulgrim initially resisted. However, through whispers from his cursed blade and seductive promises from Slaanesh itself, Fulgrim was gradually convinced to join the traitors.

The Emperor's Children's fall was unique: **they did not fall to anger or resentment; they fell to seduction**.

### The Transformation

Once committed to Chaos, the Emperor's Children underwent rapid transformation:

- **Sensory amplification**: Surgeries and modifications designed to enhance pleasure and sensation
- **Noise Marines development**: Creating warriors who wielded sonic weapons as instruments of terror
- **Aesthetic embracing**: Celebrating grotesque mutations and daemonic features as expressions of "perfection"
- **Hedonistic indulgence**: Pursuing pleasure and sensation as the ultimate goal

The legion of perfect warriors became something both more and less: **more powerful in raw ability, but enslaved to endless hunger for sensation**.

## The Philosophy: Perfection Through Excess

### The Slaaneshi Doctrine

The Emperor's Children developed a doctrine that seemed logical but was fundamentally corrupt:

"Perfection is achieved through experiencing all possibilities. Through sensation and excess, we transcend limitations. Through Slaanesh's blessings, we achieve ultimate perfection."

This doctrine corrupted the legion's original purpose: rather than pursuing perfection through discipline, they pursued it through sensation.

### The Noise Marines: Priests of Excess

**Noise Marines** became the Emperor's Children's signature warriors—marines who wielded sonic weapons that could:

- **Liquify organs**: Sound pitched at lethal frequencies
- **Shatter structures**: Waves of pure sonic force destructive at fundamental levels
- **Induce sensation**: Sound that creates overwhelming sensory experience
- **Drive enemies mad**: Psychological impact of devastating sound

A Noise Marine is not merely a warrior with superior weapons—it is a devotee of Slaanesh, pursuing pleasure through the act of destruction itself. They view combat as performance art, their weapons as instruments, and death as part of a cosmic symphony.

## The Current State: Slaanesh's Most Devoted (M42)

### The Fragmentation

Like other traitor legions, the Emperor's Children have fragmented into independent warbands and cults. However, they maintain stronger coherence than most:

**Fabius Bile's Consortium**: A faction focused on genetic experimentation and enhancement

**The Flawless Host**: Independent warbands pursuing perfection through excess

**The Slaaneshi Cabal**: Devoted followers of Slaanesh maintaining the legion's quasi-religious structure

### The Obsession

The Emperor's Children remain obsessed with perfection, but perfection of a twisted kind:

- **Sensory extremism**: Pursuing sensation to the point of self-destruction
- **Aesthetic grotesquerie**: Celebrating mutations and daemonic features
- **Performance obsession**: Viewing combat and destruction as performance art
- **Slaanesh devotion**: Serving the Chaos God with fervor matching any religious zealotry

## Combat Doctrine: Artistry & Devastation

Emperor's Children warfare emphasizes:

- **Noise Marine dominance**: Fielding heavy concentrations of sonic weapons
- **Close combat excellence**: Melee warriors of unmatched skill
- **Psychological warfare**: Using sensory overload and artistic presentation as weapons
- **Daemon summoning**: Calling upon Slaanesh's gifts for manifestations and enhancements

## Notable Figures

### Fulgrim: The Daemon Primarch

**Fulgrim** himself has ascended to Daemon Primarch status, existing as a manifestation of Slaanesh's will in realspace. He is:

- **Incomprehensibly powerful**: Rivaling Chaos Gods in raw magical power
- **Obsessed with perfection**: Still pursuing his original goal, but now through Slaanesh's lens
- **Occasionally manifesting**: Appearing in realspace to lead major campaigns or indulge in new sensations
- **Deeply corrupted**: So thoroughly merged with Slaanesh that independent thought may be impossible

### Fabius Bile: The Clonemaster

A powerful sorcerer-artificer who has become obsessed with creating the perfect warrior through genetic experimentation. Fabius conducts forbidden research into creating new marines, potentially including attempts to recreate other Primarchs from genetic material.

## Weaknesses & Vulnerabilities

**Obsession brittleness**: Excessive focus on sensation and perfection creates vulnerability to pragmatic opponents

**Internal competition**: Emperor's Children warbands often fight each other as much as enemies, pursuing superiority

**Sensory assault vulnerability**: While they weaponize sound, they are also vulnerable to sensory disruption

**Chaos dependence**: Reliance on Slaanesh's power means isolation from warp support is devastating

## The Tragedy: Virtue Weaponized

The deepest tragedy of the Emperor's Children is simple: **their greatest virtues were weaponized against them**.

They pursued perfection—a noble goal. They sought excellence—a worthy ideal. Yet through the seduction of Chaos and the corruption of their Primarch, these virtues became obsessions, and obsessions became damnation.

They are proof that even the finest warriors can fall if their virtues are twisted against them.

## Conclusion

The Emperor's Children are the legion of beautiful damnation—warriors of unmatched skill enslaved to endless hunger for sensation. They remain obsessed with perfection, but perfection of a kind that ensures their own destruction.

In their grotesque performances and sonic devastation, they demonstrate the gap between pursuit of excellence and pursuit of excess—and how easily the former can become the latter.
