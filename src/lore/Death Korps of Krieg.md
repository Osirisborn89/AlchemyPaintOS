# Death Korps of Krieg - The Hammer of the Imperium

## Introduction

The Death Korps of Krieg are not Space Marines. They are not gene-forged demigods or transhuman warriors. They are baseline humans, soldiers drawn from the industrial world of Krieg, and they are among the most effective military forces in the Imperium of Man. Where elite Space Marine squads number in the hundreds across entire sectors, the Death Korps fields armies numbering in the millions. Where other Imperial Guard regiments prioritize survival and tactical innovation, the Death Korps of Krieg embrace systematic annihilation as doctrine. They are the Imperium's hammer—blunt, brutal, and utterly effective. A Death Korps soldier does not expect to survive his service. He does not expect to return home. He expects to die, and he has made peace with that expectation. This psychological shift—from soldiers seeking survival to soldiers expecting death—makes the Death Korps fundamentally different from every other military organization in the Imperium. They do not hesitate. They do not break. They do not retreat. They advance until they are killed, and in that absolute commitment to the mission, they become more effective than warriors far more skilled or enhanced.

## Origins: Krieg & The Thermonuclear Devastation

### The Industrial Crucible

Krieg was not always the desiccated, poison-choked hellscape it is in the current era. Ten thousand years ago, Krieg was a thriving industrial world—a hive planet of staggering complexity, producing military equipment and supplies for the Imperium across multiple sectors. The world was wealthy, structured, and utterly dependent on its industrial capacity to sustain itself. All of that ended during the Horus Heresy.

When the civil war tore the Imperium apart, Krieg was caught directly in the conflict. A faction of the planetary leadership sided with the Chaos forces. The loyalist faction refused to submit. Civil war erupted on Krieg, but unlike most civil wars, this one involved entire hive-cities as battlegrounds and industrial complexes as military objectives. The war raged for decades. Hive-cities were destroyed. Industrial zones were reduced to rubble. The population was decimated. Yet neither side could achieve decisive victory. The stalemate threatened to continue indefinitely—a grinding attrition that would reduce Krieg to complete desolation.

### The Exterminatus & Resurrection

Facing an unwinnable situation and the impossibility of reclaiming Krieg through conventional means, the Imperium made a terrible decision. They deployed **Exterminatus**—a weapon of ultimate destructiveness designed to completely sterilize a planet of all life. Krieg was subjected to thermonuclear bombardment that transformed the world into a radiation-scorched wasteland. Yet Krieg did not die. Life—human life specifically—persisted in deep underground caverns and sealed bunkers designed to protect the population from atomic weapons. When the bombardment ended, survivors emerged to find their world utterly transformed. The surface was a radioactive desert. The sky was perpetually shrouded in ash and poison. The biosphere had been completely destroyed. Yet humans survived.

From those survivors, a new culture emerged. A culture born from desperation, shaped by constant exposure to death, and dedicated to rebuilding Krieg through absolute dedication and total sacrifice.

### The Reconstruction & The Death Korps

In the ten thousand years since Exterminatus, Krieg has rebuilt itself, but not as it was before. The new Krieg is a world where survival is uncertain, where radiation mutates every generation, where children are born knowing they may not reach adulthood. The culture that emerged from this crucible values duty above all else—duty to the state, duty to the Emperor, and duty to accept death when duty demands it. The armies that Krieg produces—the Death Korps—are not recruited from volunteers seeking glory. They are conscripted en masse from the population, trained with brutal efficiency, and deployed to the most dangerous warzones the Imperium can imagine. A Death Korps soldier serves until he dies. There is no retirement. There is no rotation home. There is only service, and then death.

## The Philosophy of Duty & Sacrifice

### Accept Your Death

The core philosophical principle of the Death Korps is simple: **you are already dead**. A Death Korps soldier does not see himself as a living person with prospects and future. He sees himself as a resource—a tool deployed by the state to accomplish military objectives. When the tool breaks, it is discarded and replaced. This inversion of perspective removes a critical psychological barrier. A Death Korps soldier will charge into machine gun fire without flinching. He will hold a position to the last man. He will die smiling because dying while accomplishing the mission is the highest honor he can achieve. This is not fanaticism in the sense of religious devotion. It is a rational, logical acceptance that in total war, individual survival is less important than mission completion.

### Duty Above All

Every Death Korps soldier is trained with absolute clarity on his duty. He knows exactly what he is supposed to do, where he is supposed to go, and when he is supposed to do it. There is no improvisation. There is no deviation from doctrine. There is only duty. This produces an army of mechanical precision. Death Korps soldiers do not think—they execute. They do not adapt—they follow doctrine. They do not break—they obey. When an officer gives an order, it is executed without question, without hesitation, without regard for apparent logic or self-preservation. This also means that Death Korps armies are predictable. An enemy who understands Death Korps tactics can predict Death Korps movements with near certainty. However, this predictability is a feature, not a bug. The Death Korps does not seek to surprise the enemy. It seeks to overwhelm the enemy through superior numbers, superior preparation, and absolute commitment to doctrine.

### The Debt of Krieg

Every Death Korps soldier carries with him a profound sense of debt. Krieg was destroyed. Krieg was resurrected. This resurrection is seen not as a gift but as a debt—a debt that must be repaid through absolute service to the Imperium. This theological framework provides a psychological mechanism through which Death Korps soldiers maintain morale despite the horror of their situation. They are not suffering for no reason. They are suffering to repay a debt that spans ten thousand years. Every casualty is accepted as part of the debt repayment. Every victory moves Krieg closer to the moment when its debt is finally paid.

## Organization: The Regimental Structure

### The Krieg Command Authority

The Death Korps of Krieg is not a single unified force but rather a collection of regiments, each nominally independent but all operating under a unified strategic command structure coordinated from Krieg itself. The highest authority is the **Lord Castellan of Krieg**, a position held by the most senior general currently serving. The Lord Castellan reports directly to the Administratum and coordinates Death Korps deployments across the Imperium.

### The Regiment

A Death Korps regiment typically numbers 3,000-5,000 soldiers at full strength, organized into companies of 100-150 soldiers each. Each regiment maintains its own officer cadre, its own equipment, and its own command structure, but all follow the same doctrine and maintain the same rigid discipline. Regiments are typically numbered in sequence, and the numbering system preserves a complete record of every regiment ever raised by Krieg. Even regiments destroyed thousands of years ago retain their numbers in the historical record.

### The Cadian Connection (Pre-Fall)

Before Cadia fell in M42.000, the Death Korps maintained a semi-permanent presence there, having been deployed to defend the Cadian Gate for approximately one thousand years. The Death Korps' experience on Cadia shaped an entire generation of commanders and created a deep connection between Krieg culture and Cadian defense. The fall of Cadia was a profound shock to the Death Korps. For the first time in recorded history, a position that the Death Korps was assigned to hold was abandoned. This created a theological and cultural crisis on Krieg—how could their debt be repaid if positions they held fell to the enemy? The response was predictable: increased deployment of Death Korps regiments across the Imperium, acceptance of even more dangerous assignments, and redoubling of commitment to the philosophy that sacrifice and duty will eventually overcome all obstacles.

## Arsenal & Wargear

### The Mosin Nagant Pattern Rifle

The Death Korps' primary weapon is the **Mosin Nagant Pattern Rifle**, a las-rifle of ancient design that fires conventional laser bolts. The weapon is reliable, effective, and above all, simple. A Death Korps soldier can maintain his rifle in radioactive wastelands with minimal resources. The rifle is not exceptionally powerful compared to weapons fielded by other Imperial military forces. However, when deployed en masse by soldiers committed to overwhelming firepower concentration, the Mosin Nagant becomes devastatingly effective.

### Lasguns & Support Weapons

Death Korps regiments carry a mix of las-weapons including standard lasguns, heavy bolters, and specialized support weapons. However, unlike other Imperial Guard regiments which might emphasize firepower versatility, Death Korps regiments emphasize firepower concentration—multiple weapons focused on single targets to ensure destruction.

### Gas Masks & Protective Gear

Every Death Korps soldier carries a gas mask and protective gear—legacy equipment designed to protect against the radiation and chemical contamination that characterized Krieg's devastated biosphere. This equipment is worn as much for psychological effect as for practical protection. A Death Korps soldier in full protective gear is an iconic image of the Imperium's commitment to absolute duty.

### Trench & Fortification Tools

Death Korps soldiers carry specialized tools designed for rapid construction of trenches, fortifications, and defensive positions. The Death Korps philosophy emphasizes fortification and entrenchment—establish a defensive position, dig in, and hold until relieved or killed.

### Vehicles & Support

The Death Korps fields a mix of armored vehicles including Chimera infantry transports, Leman Russ battle tanks, Basilisk self-propelled artillery, Sentinel light reconnaissance walkers, and Valkyrie air transport. All vehicles are maintained in excellent condition despite the harsh environment, reflecting the Death Korps' absolute commitment to equipment maintenance and logistical excellence.

## Combat Doctrine: The Grinding Advance

### The Meat Grinder

Death Korps combat doctrine is fundamentally simple: overwhelm the enemy through superior numbers and absolute commitment to the objective. A Death Korps assault involves massed infantry attacks, supported by heavy firepower, designed to break enemy lines through sheer pressure. Individual soldiers are not expected to be creative or adaptive. They are expected to follow orders, advance, and kill enemies until they are killed themselves. When casualties reach critical levels, reinforcements arrive and the assault continues. This doctrine is incredibly effective against most enemy forces because it removes the psychological component of warfare.

### Fortification & Defense

When defending, the Death Korps transforms landscapes into fortress systems. Trenches are dug with geometric precision. Fortifications are constructed to maximize firepower coverage. Artillery is positioned to provide overlapping fields of fire. Reserves are held in deep fortified positions for counter-assault. A Death Korps position held to the last soldier is more defensible than positions held by far more skilled military forces because the Death Korps soldier has accepted death and will not break when the situation becomes desperate.

### Artillery Dominance

The Death Korps maintains exceptional artillery, with Basilisks and other support weapons providing overwhelming firepower. A Death Korps assault is typically preceded by hours or days of artillery bombardment designed to soften enemy positions before infantry assault. This emphasis on artillery reflects Krieg's industrial heritage and the Death Korps' philosophy that overwhelming firepower is preferable to tactical improvisation.

### No Mercy, No Retreat, No Surrender

Death Korps soldiers do not take prisoners except when specifically ordered. They do not negotiate. They do not retreat. They do not surrender. When an enemy force appears, the only acceptable outcomes are enemy destruction or Death Korps destruction. This inflexibility sometimes leads to tactically suboptimal outcomes, but it provides psychological advantages that often more than compensate for tactical limitations.

## Notable Death Korps Leaders

### Colonel 'Iron Hand' Straken

The legendary commander of the Cadian Shock Troops, Straken has survived more battles than any other Death Korps officer. He is known for leading from the front, accepting wound after wound, and never backing down from any objective.

### Lord Castellan Krel

The current supreme commander of all Death Korps forces, Krel has overseen the massive redeployment of Krieg regiments across the Imperium following Cadia's fall. Krel is renowned for his strategic brilliance and his absolute commitment to Krieg doctrine.

### Captain Chem

A legendary captain known for his ruthlessness and his absolute commitment to objectives. Chem has conducted defensive campaigns lasting years, holding positions against overwhelming odds through sheer determination and doctrine adherence.

## Recent History: M42 & The Renewed Offensive

In the current era, the Death Korps has been mobilized on an unprecedented scale. With Cadia fallen and large regions of the Imperium in disarray, the Administratum has called up nearly every Death Korps regiment to participate in counter-offensives.

### The Cadia Evacuation & Redeployment

When Cadia fell, the Death Korps units defending the world fought to the last soldier to buy time for civilian evacuation. This sacrifice, while ultimately unsuccessful in saving Cadia, demonstrated the Death Korps' absolute commitment to duty. The surviving Death Korps regiments were immediately redeployed to establish new defensive lines across the Cadian Sector, leading multiple counter-offensives against Chaos forces.

### The Attrition War

The Death Korps now finds itself engaged in attritional warfare across multiple fronts. Regiments are deployed to hold worlds, conduct assaults, and establish defensive positions. Casualty rates are catastrophic by conventional standards—entire regiments are destroyed and replaced within months. This is perfectly acceptable from a Death Korps perspective. They are doing their duty. They are repaying Krieg's debt. The casualties are expected, accepted, and incorporated into the broader strategy.

### Mechanization & Evolution

Despite their traditional focus on infantry, the Death Korps has adapted to modern warfare by incorporating more mechanized elements. Tank companies now operate alongside infantry squads. Artillery support is more integrated. Air support is coordinated with ground operations. This evolution does not represent a fundamental shift in Death Korps philosophy—duty and sacrifice remain paramount—but rather an adaptation of doctrine to address the scale of threats currently facing the Imperium.

## Weaknesses & Limitations

### Predictability

Death Korps warfare is utterly predictable. An enemy who understands Death Korps doctrine can predict Death Korps movements with near certainty. Enemies can establish defensive positions, concentrate firepower, and prepare for Death Korps assault patterns.

### Inflexibility

Death Korps soldiers are trained to follow doctrine, not to adapt. If circumstances change in ways not anticipated by doctrine, Death Korps soldiers may struggle to respond effectively. A guerrilla enemy that refuses to engage in conventional warfare can exhaust Death Korps forces without committing to decisive battle.

### Dependency on Logistics

Death Korps warfare depends absolutely on reliable logistics. Artillery ammunition, food, medical supplies, and replacement troops must arrive on schedule. If logistics are disrupted, Death Korps offensive capability collapses.

### Morale Fragility

While Death Korps soldiers are disciplined and committed to duty, the psychological burden of the "accept your death" philosophy eventually breaks even the most committed soldiers. After sufficient combat, psychological casualties mount even if biological casualties are replaced.

### Limited Tactical Flexibility

Death Korps doctrine emphasizes firepower concentration and straightforward assault. Enemies that employ deception, ambush, or non-linear tactics can sometimes exploit the Death Korps' inability to adapt beyond established doctrine.

## Aesthetic & Culture

The Death Korps embrace a martial aesthetic of discipline and sacrifice. Their uniforms are practical and designed for harsh environments. Their equipment is maintained to perfection. Their fortifications are geometric and efficient. There is no beauty in Death Korps culture—only function. Death Korps soldiers often wear gas masks even in safe environments, partly for practical reasons but also as a cultural symbol of their connection to Krieg's radiation-poisoned biosphere.

Death Korps culture celebrates sacrifice, duty, and the acceptance of death. Soldiers who distinguish themselves are remembered—their names are recorded in permanent registers maintained on Krieg. This is considered the highest honor a Death Korps soldier can achieve: to be remembered as having served with honor.

## Conclusion

The Death Korps of Krieg represent the Imperium's most perfectly disciplined military force. They are not the strongest or most skilled soldiers in the galaxy. They are not enhanced beyond baseline humanity. They are simply soldiers who have accepted death and dedicated themselves absolutely to duty. In a galaxy where individual survival is often prioritized over mission completion, the Death Korps stand apart as warriors willing to sacrifice everything for the Emperor. They hold positions that cannot be held. They conduct assaults that cannot be won. They do this not because they are foolish but because duty demands it. In the grim darkness of the far future, the Death Korps of Krieg march toward their deaths with absolute certainty and perfect discipline, and in that commitment to duty, they have become the Imperium's greatest weapon.
